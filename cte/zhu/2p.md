Here are the answers to your questions.

### (a) Harvard Architecture

The **Harvard architecture** is a computer architecture that uses separate memory and separate buses for instructions and data. This is in contrast to the Von Neumann architecture, which uses a single memory and bus for both.

**Diagram:**
The core idea is the physical separation of instruction and data pathways to the CPU.

```
      +-----------------+
      |                 |
      |       CPU       |
      |                 |
      +--------+--------+
               |
      +--------+--------+
      |                 |
Instruction Bus   Data Bus
      |                 |
+-----v------+   +------v-----+
| Instruction|   |    Data    |
|   Memory   |   |   Memory   |
+------------+   +------------+
```

**Storage of Data and Instructions:**

1.  **Instruction Storage:** All program instructions are stored in a dedicated **Instruction Memory**. The CPU fetches instructions from this memory using a dedicated **Instruction Bus**.
2.  **Data Storage:** All data, variables, and constants used by the program are stored in a separate **Data Memory**. The CPU accesses this data using a dedicated **Data Bus**.

The primary advantage of this separation is that the CPU can fetch an instruction and access data simultaneously, leading to improved performance and higher throughput. This is because instruction fetches and data operations do not compete for the same bus. This architecture is very common in microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs).

### (b) Execution of a High-Level Language Program Segment

The execution of the program segment `int a=25, b=75, c; c=b-a;` involves two main stages: compilation and execution.

**1. Compilation:**
The high-level C code is first translated by a compiler into low-level machine code (or assembly language) that the computer's processor can understand. During this process, the compiler performs the following:

  * **Memory Allocation:** It reserves three memory locations in the data segment for the integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.
  * **Code Generation:** It generates a sequence of machine instructions to perform the specified operations.

**2. Execution:**
The CPU executes the generated machine code step-by-step.

1.  **Initialization:**

      * The instruction to initialize `a` is executed. The value `25` is loaded into the memory address assigned to variable `a`.
      * The instruction to initialize `b` is executed. The value `75` is loaded into the memory address assigned to variable `b`.

2.  **Calculation (`c = b - a`):**

      * **Load:** The CPU's control unit issues a command to load the value from `b`'s memory address into a CPU register (e.g., `Register 1`). So, `Register 1` now holds `75`.
      * **Load:** The value from `a`'s memory address is loaded into another CPU register (e.g., `Register 2`). So, `Register 2` now holds `25`.
      * **Subtract:** The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is instructed to perform a subtraction on the values in `Register 1` and `Register 2`. The result, `75 - 25 = 50`, is stored in a designated result register (e.g., `Register 3`).
      * **Store:** The value from the result register (`50`) is stored back into the memory location reserved for variable `c`.

After these steps, the memory location for `c` will hold the value `50`.

### (c) Number Conversions

**(i) Decimal $(9567438120)_{10}$ to Binary and Hexadecimal**

First, convert Decimal to Hexadecimal by repeatedly dividing by 16:

  * $9567438120 \div 16 = 597964882 \text{ Remainder } 8$
  * $597964882 \div 16 = 37372805 \text{ Remainder } 2$
  * $37372805 \div 16 = 2335800 \text{ Remainder } 5$
  * $2335800 \div 16 = 145987 \text{ Remainder } 8$
  * $145987 \div 16 = 9124 \text{ Remainder } 3$
  * $9124 \div 16 = 570 \text{ Remainder } 4$
  * $570 \div 16 = 35 \text{ Remainder } 10 \text{ (A)}$
  * $35 \div 16 = 2 \text{ Remainder } 3$
  * $2 \div 16 = 0 \text{ Remainder } 2$

Reading the remainders from bottom to top:

  * **Hexadecimal:** $(23A438528)_{16}$

Now, convert Hexadecimal to Binary by converting each hex digit to its 4-bit representation:

  * `2` -\> `0010`
  * `3` -\> `0011`
  * `A` -\> `1010`
  * `4` -\> `0100`
  * `3` -\> `0011`
  * `8` -\> `1000`
  * `5` -\> `0101`
  * `2` -\> `0010`
  * `8` -\> `1000`
  * **Binary:** $(1000111010010000111000010100101000)_2$

**(ii) Hexadecimal $(8FAEB1DC)_h$ to Binary and Octal**

First, convert Hexadecimal to Binary:

  * `8` -\> `1000`
  * `F` -\> `1111`
  * `A` -\> `1010`
  * `E` -\> `1110`
  * `B` -\> `1011`
  * `1` -\> `0001`
  * `D` -\> `1101`
  * `C` -\> `1100`
  * **Binary:** $(10001111101011101011000111011100)_2$

Now, convert Binary to Octal by grouping bits in sets of 3 from right to left (pad the leftmost group with a `0` to make it 3 bits):

  * `010 001 111 101 011 101 011 000 111 011 100`
  * `2   1   7   5   3   5   3   0   7   3   4`
  * **Octal:** $(21753530734)_8$

**(iii) ASCII String “ABCabc$\#4325 & Unicode” to UTF-8**

All the characters in the given string (`A`, `B`, `C`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `$`, `#`, `4`, `3`, `2`, `5`, `     `, `&`, `U`, `n`, `i`, `c`, `o`, `d`, `e`) are part of the standard **ASCII character set**. The Unicode code points for these characters are all below `U+0080` (or 128 decimal).

For any character with a Unicode code point from `U+0000` to `U+007F`, the **UTF-8 encoding is identical to its 7-bit ASCII value**, represented in a single byte.

Therefore, the UTF-8 encoding is simply the sequence of the ASCII byte values for each character. For example:

  * 'A' -\> Hex `41` -\> UTF-8 `41`
  * 'B' -\> Hex `42` -\> UTF-8 `42`
  * 'C' -\> Hex `43` -\> UTF-8 `43`
  * ...
  * '$' -\> Hex `24` -\> UTF-8 `24`
  * '\#' -\> Hex `23` -\> UTF-8 `23`

The complete UTF-8 encoded string would be the sequence of these single-byte values.

**(iv) Octal $(41302576)_O$ to Decimal**

Convert from base 8 to base 10 using positional notation:

  * $F = (4 \times 8^7) + (1 \times 8^6) + (3 \times 8^5) + (0 \times 8^4) + (2 \times 8^3) + (5 \times 8^2) + (7 \times 8^1) + (6 \times 8^0)$
  * $F = (4 \times 2097152) + (1 \times 262144) + (3 \times 32768) + (0 \times 4096) + (2 \times 512) + (5 \times 64) + (7 \times 8) + (6 \times 1)$
  * $F = 8388608 + 262144 + 98304 + 0 + 1024 + 320 + 56 + 6$
  * **Decimal:** $8750462_{10}$

### (d) K-map Simplification

The function is $F(A, B, C, D) = \Sigma (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15)$.

**K-map:**

```
      CD
      00   01   11   10
AB 00 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
   01 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
   11 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
   10 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
```

**Grouping:**

1.  **Group 1 (Blue):** A group of 4 combining minterms `m0, m2, m4, m6`.
      * For this group, A is constant at `0` (`A'`). B changes. C changes. D is constant at `0` (`D'`).
      * Term: $A'D'$
2.  **Group 2 (Red):** A group of 4 combining minterms `m0, m2, m8, m10` (wraparound).
      * For this group, A changes. B is constant at `0` (`B'`). C changes. D is constant at `0` (`D'`).
      * Term: $B'D'$
3.  **Group 3 (Green):** A single minterm `m15`.
      * Term: $ABCD$

**Simplified Function:**
The simplified Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression is the sum of the terms from the groups:
$F = A'D' + B'D' + ABCD$

**Circuit using NAND gates:**
To implement this using only NAND gates, we use the NAND-NAND logic form. We can convert the SOP expression by double-negating it and applying De Morgan's theorem.

$F = \overline{\overline{A'D' + B'D' + ABCD}}$
$F = \overline{\overline{(A'D')} \cdot \overline{(B'D')} \cdot \overline{(ABCD)}}$

This final expression can be implemented as a three-input NAND gate fed by the outputs of three other NAND gates.

  * The term $\overline{A'D'}$ is implemented as `A' NAND D'`.
  * The term $\overline{B'D'}$ is implemented as `B' NAND D'`.
  * The term $\overline{ABCD}$ is implemented as `A NAND B NAND C NAND D`.
  * The inputs `A'` and `B'` can be generated using NAND gates as inverters (`A NAND A` gives `A'`).

**Logic Diagram:**

The circuit requires:

  * One NAND gate for `A'` (`A NAND A`).
  * One NAND gate for `B'` (`B NAND B`).
  * One NAND gate for `D'` (`D NAND D`).
  * One NAND gate for `(A'D')'`.
  * One NAND gate for `(B'D')'`.
  * One 4-input NAND gate for `(ABCD)'`.
  * One 3-input NAND gate for the final output F.

### (e) Adder-Subtractor Circuit

The Adder-Subtractor circuit performs subtraction `(A - B)` by calculating the 2's complement of B and adding it to A. That is, $A - B = A + (B' + 1)$.

The circuit uses a parallel adder and XOR gates. For subtraction, a control input `S` is set to `1`. This has two effects:

1.  The initial carry-in to the adder, $C_{in}$, is set to `1`.
2.  Each bit of B passes through an XOR gate where the other input is `S=1`. Since $B_i \oplus 1 = B'_i$, the XOR gates invert each bit of B.

**Calculation for A = 0011 and B = 1101:**

1.  **Inputs:**

      * $A = 0011$
      * $B = 1101$
      * Control `S = 1` (for subtraction)

2.  **Circuit Operation:**

      * $C_{in}$ becomes `1`.
      * B is inverted by the XOR gates: $B' = 0010$.

3.  **Addition:** The circuit now performs $A + B' + C_{in}$.

    ```
      Cout C3 C2 C1 Cin (Carries)
           1  1  1  1   <-- Initial Cin is 1
         0  0  1  1     (A)
      +  0  0  1  0     (B')
      -----------------
      0  0  1  1  0     (Result S)
    ```

      * **Bit 0:** $1 + 0 + 1 (C_{in}) = 0$, Carry-out $C_1 = 1$.
      * **Bit 1:** $1 + 1 + 1 (C_1) = 1$, Carry-out $C_2 = 1$.
      * **Bit 2:** $0 + 0 + 1 (C_2) = 1$, Carry-out $C_3 = 0$.
      * **Bit 3:** $0 + 0 + 0 (C_3) = 0$, Carry-out $C_{out} = 0$.

**Final Values:**

  * **Result:** The sum is `0110`.
  * $C_{in}$: `1`
  * $C_{out}$: `0` (the final carry from the MSB addition)
  * **Overflow:** Overflow (V) is detected by XORing the carry into the MSB stage ($C_3$) with the carry out of the MSB stage ($C_{out}$).
      * $V = C_3 \oplus C_{out} = 0 \oplus 0 = 0$.
      * Since $V=0$, there is **no overflow**.

The decimal equivalent is $3 - (-3) = 6$. The result $(0110)_2$ is 6, which is correct.

### (f) 4x1 Multiplexer

A **4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX)** is a digital circuit that selects one of its four data inputs ($I_0, I_1, I_2, I_3$) and routes it to a single output line (Y). The selection is controlled by two select lines ($S_1, S_0$).

**Truth Table:**

| $S_1$ | $S_0$ | Output (Y) |
| :---: | :---: | :--------: |
|   0   |   0   |   $I_0$    |
|   0   |   1   |   $I_1$    |
|   1   |   0   |   $I_2$    |
|   1   |   1   |   $I_3$    |

The Boolean expression for the output Y is:
$Y = S'_1S'_0I_0 + S'_1S_0I_1 + S_1S'_0I_2 + S_1S_0I_3$

**Logic Diagram:**

The diagram consists of:

  * Four 3-input AND gates.
  * One 4-input OR gate.
  * Two inverters (for $S_1$ and $S_0$).

**Functioning and Example:**
The select lines $S_1$ and $S_0$ act as a 2-bit binary number that corresponds to the index of the input line to be selected.

**Example:**
Suppose we want to select the input $I_2$ and pass its value to the output Y.

1.  We set the select lines to the binary equivalent of 2: $S_1 = 1$ and $S_0 = 0$.
2.  The logic gates evaluate as follows:
      * The AND gate for $I_0$ receives $(S'_1, S'_0, I_0) = (0, 1, I_0)$, so its output is 0.
      * The AND gate for $I_1$ receives $(S'_1, S_0, I_1) = (0, 0, I_1)$, so its output is 0.
      * The AND gate for $I_2$ receives $(S_1, S'_0, I_2) = (1, 1, I_2)$, so its output is $I_2$.
      * The AND gate for $I_3$ receives $(S_1, S_0, I_3) = (1, 0, I_3)$, so its output is 0.
3.  The OR gate receives the inputs $(0, 0, I_2, 0)$.
4.  The final output is $Y = 0 + 0 + I_2 + 0 = I_2$.

Thus, the value of input $I_2$ is successfully routed to the output Y.

### (g) Hamming's Error-Correcting Code

We need to encode the 4-bit data `1111` so that a single-bit error can be corrected.

**1. Determine Parity Bits:**

  * Number of data bits, $m = 4$.
  * Number of parity bits, $p$, is found using the formula: $2^p \geq m + p + 1$.
  * For $p=3$, $2^3 = 8$ and $m+p+1 = 4+3+1 = 8$. Since $8 \geq 8$, we need **3 parity bits**.
  * Total codeword length will be $m+p = 7$ bits.

**2. Position Bits:**
Parity bits ($P_1, P_2, P_4$) are placed at positions that are powers of 2. Data bits ($D_3, D_5, D_6, D_7$) fill the rest. Source data `1111` maps to $D_3, D_5, D_6, D_7$.

  * Codeword structure: $P_1 P_2 D_3 P_4 D_5 D_6 D_7$
  * With data bits filled: $P_1 P_2 1 P_4 1 1 1$

**3. Calculate Parity Bits (Even Parity):**

  * $P_1$ checks bits (1, 3, 5, 7): $P_1 = D_3 \oplus D_5 \oplus D_7 = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1$.
  * $P_2$ checks bits (2, 3, 6, 7): $P_2 = D_3 \oplus D_6 \oplus D_7 = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1$.
  * $P_4$ checks bits (4, 5, 6, 7): $P_4 = D_5 \oplus D_6 \oplus D_7 = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1$.

**4. Construct Transmitted Codeword:**
The complete codeword is `1111111`.

**5. Error During Transmission:**
The problem states the source data `1111` was received as `0111`. This implies the most significant data bit flipped during transmission. This corresponds to bit $D_7$ (position 7) changing from 1 to 0.

  * **Transmitted Code:** `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  * **Received Code (with error):** `1 1 1 1 1 1 0` (Bit at position 7 is flipped)

**6. Error Detection and Correction at Destination:**
The receiver recalculates the parity checks using the received data to find the syndrome bits ($S_1, S_2, S_4$).

  * $S_1 = P_{1r} \oplus D_{3r} \oplus D_{5r} \oplus D_{7r} = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 = 1$.
  * $S_2 = P_{2r} \oplus D_{3r} \oplus D_{6r} \oplus D_{7r} = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 = 1$.
  * $S_4 = P_{4r} \oplus D_{5r} \oplus D_{6r} \oplus D_{7r} = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 = 1$.

The **syndrome word** is $S_4S_2S_1 = 111$. The decimal value of this binary number is $4+2+1 = 7$. This indicates that the **error is in bit position 7**.

To correct the error, the receiver flips the bit at position 7 of the received codeword:

  * Corrected Codeword: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`.
  * Extracting the data bits from positions 3, 5, 6, and 7 gives the corrected data: `1111`.

### (h) JK Flip-Flop

The **JK flip-flop** is a versatile sequential logic circuit that refines the SR flip-flop by eliminating the undefined state. It has J (Set) and K (Reset) inputs. Its main feature is the "toggle" mode, where the output inverts on each clock pulse when J and K are both high.

**Logic Diagram:**
A JK flip-flop is typically constructed from an SR latch with additional logic at the inputs.

**Characteristic Table:**
This table defines the next state of the flip-flop, $Q(t+1)$, based on the current inputs and the current state, $Q(t)$.

| J | K | $Q(t)$ | $Q(t+1)$ | Mode      |
|:-:|:-:|:------:|:--------:|:----------|
| 0 | 0 |    0   |     0    | No Change |
| 0 | 0 |    1   |     1    | No Change |
| 0 | 1 |    0   |     0    | Reset     |
| 0 | 1 |    1   |     0    | Reset     |
| 1 | 0 |    0   |     1    | Set       |
| 1 | 0 |    1   |     1    | Set       |
| 1 | 1 |    0   |     1    | Toggle    |
| 1 | 1 |    1   |     0    | Toggle    |

**Excitation Table:**
This table is used for circuit design. It specifies the required J and K inputs to achieve a desired transition from a present state $Q(t)$ to a next state $Q(t+1)$. 'X' denotes a "don't care" condition, which helps in simplifying logic.

| $Q(t)$ | $Q(t+1)$ | J | K | Explanation                               |
|:------:|:--------:|:-:|:-:|:------------------------------------------|
|    0   |     0    | 0 | X | Stay at 0 (No change or Reset)            |
|    0   |     1    | 1 | X | Go from 0 to 1 (Set or Toggle from 0)     |
|    1   |     0    | X | 1 | Go from 1 to 0 (Reset or Toggle from 1)     |
|    1   |     1    | X | 0 | Stay at 1 (No change or Set)              |

For example, to transition from Q=0 to Q=1, we must set J=1. We don't care what K is, because if K=0 (Set mode) the output becomes 1, and if K=1 (Toggle mode) the output also becomes 1.

### (i) Master-Slave Flip-Flop

A **Master-Slave flip-flop** is constructed from two cascaded flip-flops (the master and the slave) to prevent the "race-around" condition found in simple level-triggered flip-flops. This configuration effectively creates an edge-triggered device.

**Diagram:**

The circuit consists of:

  * A **Master** flip-flop (e.g., a JK flip-flop) that receives the external J and K inputs. It is activated when the clock (CLK) is HIGH.
  * A **Slave** flip-flop that receives its inputs from the Master's outputs. It is activated by the inverted clock (CLK'), meaning it is active when the clock is LOW.
  * The final output of the entire device is the output of the Slave flip-flop.

**Functioning:**
The operation is a two-stage process synchronized with the clock pulse.

1.  **When CLK is HIGH (Clock pulse rises):**

      * The Master flip-flop is enabled and accepts the external J and K inputs. It changes its state according to these inputs.
      * The Slave flip-flop is disabled because its clock input (CLK') is LOW. Its output remains unchanged. Therefore, the overall output of the master-slave device does not change during this phase.

2.  **When CLK goes LOW (Clock pulse falls):**

      * The Master flip-flop is disabled. Its state, captured at the moment the clock went low, is now stable.
      * The Slave flip-flop is enabled because its clock input (CLK') is now HIGH. It copies the state from the now-stable Master flip-flop.
      * The output of the Slave (and thus the entire device) now changes to reflect the new state.

This mechanism ensures that the output only changes on the **falling edge** of the clock pulse, isolating the inputs from the outputs and preventing the race-around condition.
