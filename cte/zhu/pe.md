# Step-by-step SRTF explanation and calculations

Nice — let’s walk through **exactly how SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)** decides what to run, and compute the completion times for **B, C, D** (we’ll also recap A), then compute turnaround and waiting times. I’ll show the key decision points (arrivals/completions) and the remaining-time comparisons that determine which job runs.

---

## Quick rules of SRTF

* At any moment the CPU runs the *ready* process with the **smallest remaining CPU time**.
* If a new process arrives whose remaining time is **less than** the currently running process’s remaining time, the CPU **preempts** and switches to the new one.
* If two ready processes have the same remaining time, a tie-breaker is needed (common choices: earlier arrival first, or fixed priority). We won’t hit a tie here.

---

## Given jobs

| Job | Arrival time | Total run time (burst) |
| --- | -----------: | ---------------------: |
| A   |            0 |                      4 |
| B   |            2 |                      5 |
| C   |            3 |                      6 |
| D   |            5 |                      5 |

---

## Timeline and decision points (detailed)

We'll show the system state at the times when arrivals or completions happen: `t = 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 14, 20`. At each point we list which jobs are ready and their remaining times, then say what runs next.

### t = 0

* Arrived: A (remaining = 4)
* Ready queue: A(4) → **A runs**.

A runs from **t = 0 → t = 2** (no other arrivals yet). After 2 units of execution:

* A remaining = 4 − 2 = **2**.

### t = 2 (B arrives)

* Newly arrived: B (remaining = 5)
* Ready: A(2), B(5)
* **Shortest remaining** is A(2) < B(5) → **A continues**.

A runs from **t = 2 → t = 3** (1 unit), leaving:

* A remaining = 2 − 1 = **1**.

### t = 3 (C arrives)

* Newly arrived: C (remaining = 6)
* Ready: A(1), B(5), C(6)
* Shortest remaining is A(1) → **A continues**.

A runs from **t = 3 → t = 4** (1 unit) and **completes at t = 4**.
So **Completion time(A) = 4**.

---

### t = 4 (after A finishes)

* Ready now: B(5) [arrived at 2], C(6) [arrived at 3]
* Compare remaining: B(5) vs C(6) → **B is shorter** → **B starts at t = 4**.

B runs from **t = 4 → t = 5** (1 unit). After that:

* B remaining = 5 − 1 = **4**.

### t = 5 (D arrives)

* Newly arrived: D (remaining = 5)
* Ready: B(4), C(6), D(5)
* Compare remaining times: B(4), D(5), C(6) → **B has the shortest remaining (4)** → **B continues** (no preemption).

B runs from **t = 5 → t = 9** (4 more units) and **completes at t = 9**.
So **Completion time(B) = 9**.

---

### t = 9 (after B finishes)

* Ready: C(6), D(5)
* Compare: D(5) vs C(6) → **D is shorter** → **D runs**.

D runs from **t = 9 → t = 14** (5 units) and **completes at t = 14**.
So **Completion time(D) = 14**.

---

### t = 14 (after D finishes)

* Only C remains: C(6) → **C runs from 14 → 20** and **completes at t = 20**.
  So **Completion time(C) = 20**.

---

## Gantt-chart style summary (intervals)

```
0 —— 4 : A
4 —— 9 : B
9 ——14 : D
14——20 : C
```

(Each arrow interval shows the job running on CPU during that time.)

---

## Why that order? (shortest-remaining comparisons)

At each arrival/completion we compared the **remaining burst** of all ready jobs. If the newly arrived job had a **smaller remaining time** than the currently running job, it would preempt. In this scenario:

* When B arrived at t=2, A had remaining=2 which was still smaller → no preempt.
* When C arrived at t=3, A had remaining=1 → no preempt.
* When D arrived at t=5, B had remaining=4 which was smaller than D's 5 → no preempt.
* After B finished at t=9, among waiting jobs D(5) and C(6) we picked D (5 < 6).
  So SRTF simply chooses the smallest remaining among *ready* jobs at every decision point.

---

## Turnaround time and Waiting time calculations

Formulas:

* **Turnaround time** (TAT) = Completion time − Arrival time
* **Waiting time** (WT) = Turnaround time − Run time

We already have completion times:
A=4, B=9, C=20, D=14.

Compute per job:

| Job | Arrival | Run | Completion | Turnaround = C − A | Waiting = TAT − Run |
| --- | ------: | --: | ---------: | -----------------: | ------------------: |
| A   |       0 |   4 |          4 |      4 − 0 = **4** |       4 − 4 = **0** |
| B   |       2 |   5 |          9 |      9 − 2 = **7** |       7 − 5 = **2** |
| C   |       3 |   6 |         20 |    20 − 3 = **17** |     17 − 6 = **11** |
| D   |       5 |   5 |         14 |     14 − 5 = **9** |       9 − 5 = **4** |

Average values:

* **Average Turnaround** = (4 + 7 + 17 + 9) / 4 = 37 / 4 = **9.25**
* **Average Waiting** = (0 + 2 + 11 + 4) / 4 = 17 / 4 = **4.25**

---

## Key takeaways (to solidify understanding)

1. **SRTF is preemptive** — a running job can be interrupted if a newly arrived job has **less remaining time**.
2. At every **arrival** or **completion** we re-evaluate the ready set and pick the job with the smallest remaining time.
3. You only need to compare *remaining* times of ready processes — not total burst times of not-yet-arrived jobs.
4. SRTF minimizes average waiting time among non-pathological inputs but needs accurate knowledge of remaining times and can cause starvation for long jobs.
5. For bookkeeping, it helps to write the system state at key instants (arrivals and completions) listing remaining times — that’s what we did above.

---

If you want, I can:

* show the same scheduling with a **per-unit time table** (listing running process and remaining times at every integer time) for extra clarity, or
* produce a **neat diagram** you can paste into your assignment. Which would help you more?


# 0


Perfect — this is a classic **CPU Scheduling** assignment question.
Let’s carefully solve it **step by step** for all three algorithms: **SRTF**, **SJF**, and **Round Robin (q=2)**.

---

## Given Data

| Job | Arrival Time | Run Time |
| --- | ------------ | -------- |
| A   | 0            | 4        |
| B   | 2            | 5        |
| C   | 3            | 6        |
| D   | 5            | 5        |

---

## (a) SRTF — *Shortest Remaining Time First*

SRTF is a **preemptive** version of SJF. The CPU always executes the process with the **shortest remaining time** among those that have **arrived**.

Let’s go **time unit by time unit**:

| Time  | Process Running                                             | Comments                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0–2   | **A**                                                       | A(remaining=2) when B arrives at 2 |
| 2–3   | **A** (A=1 left), B arrives (5), C not yet arrived          |                                    |
| 3     | C arrives (6). Remaining: A=1, B=5, C=6 → shortest is A     |                                    |
| 3–4   | **A completes**                                             |                                    |
| 4–5   | Ready: B(5), C(6) → choose B (shorter). D not yet arrived   |                                    |
| 5     | D arrives (5). Now B(4 left), C(6), D(5) → B still shortest |                                    |
| 5–9   | **B completes**                                             |                                    |
| 9     | Remaining: C(6), D(5) → D shorter                           |                                    |
| 9–14  | **D completes**                                             |                                    |
| 14–20 | **C completes**                                             |                                    |

✅ **Completion Times**

| Job | Arrival | Run | Completion | Turnaround (CT–AT) | Waiting (TAT–Run) |
| --- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| A   | 0       | 4   | 4          | 4                  | 0                 |
| B   | 2       | 5   | 9          | 7                  | 2                 |
| C   | 3       | 6   | 20         | 17                 | 11                |
| D   | 5       | 5   | 14         | 9                  | 4                 |

**Average Turnaround Time = (4+7+17+9)/4 = 37/4 = 9.25**
**Average Waiting Time = (0+2+11+4)/4 = 17/4 = 4.25**

---

## (b) SJF — *Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)*

We schedule the job that has the **shortest burst time** among the ones **available** at the moment the CPU becomes free.

### Step-by-step:

1. **At t=0**, only A is available → run A till completion (0–4)
2. **At t=4**, available: B(5), C(6), D(5 at 5 not yet arrived) → pick **B**
3. **B runs 4–9**, during that time D arrives at 5, but CPU stays with B (non-preemptive)
4. **At t=9**, remaining: C(6), D(5) → choose **D** (shorter)
5. **D runs 9–14**
6. **Finally, C runs 14–20**

✅ **Completion Times**

| Job | Arrival | Run | Completion | Turnaround | Waiting |
| --- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| A   | 0       | 4   | 4          | 4          | 0       |
| B   | 2       | 5   | 9          | 7          | 2       |
| D   | 5       | 5   | 14         | 9          | 4       |
| C   | 3       | 6   | 20         | 17         | 11      |

**Average Turnaround = (4+7+9+17)/4 = 37/4 = 9.25**
**Average Waiting = (0+2+4+11)/4 = 17/4 = 4.25**

➡️ Interestingly, **SJF and SRTF** give the *same results* for this data (because preemption didn’t change the order).

---

## (c) Round Robin (Quantum = 2)

We’ll simulate time slices of 2 units.

### Step-by-step Gantt chart simulation:

| Time  | Process | Remaining                      | Notes          |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| 0–2   | A       | 2 left                         | B arrives at 2 |
| 2–4   | B       | 3 left                         | C arrives at 3 |
| 4–6   | A       | done                           | D arrives at 5 |
| 6–8   | C       | 4 left                         |                |
| 8–10  | D       | 3 left                         |                |
| 10–12 | B       | 1 left                         |                |
| 12–14 | C       | 2 left                         |                |
| 14–15 | B       | done (1 unit left from before) |                |
| 15–17 | D       | 1 left                         |                |
| 17–19 | C       | done                           |                |
| 19–20 | D       | done                           |                |

✅ **Completion Times**

| Job | Arrival | Run | Completion | Turnaround | Waiting |
| --- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| A   | 0       | 4   | 6          | 6          | 2       |
| B   | 2       | 5   | 15         | 13         | 8       |
| C   | 3       | 6   | 19         | 16         | 10      |
| D   | 5       | 5   | 20         | 15         | 10      |

**Average Turnaround = (6+13+16+15)/4 = 50/4 = 12.5**
**Average Waiting = (2+8+10+10)/4 = 30/4 = 7.5**

---

## ✅ Final Summary Table

| Method       | Completion Times (A,B,C,D) | Avg Turnaround | Avg Waiting |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| **SRTF**     | 4, 9, 20, 14               | 9.25           | 4.25        |
| **SJF**      | 4, 9, 20, 14               | 9.25           | 4.25        |
| **RR (q=2)** | 6, 15, 19, 20              | 12.5           | 7.5         |

---

Would you like me to create a **Gantt chart diagram** for each method (for easy inclusion in your IGNOU assignment)?

# 1

Good question — let’s unpack that clearly.

### 🔹 SJF (Shortest Job First)

**Shortest Job First (SJF)** is a CPU scheduling algorithm that picks the process with the **shortest CPU burst time** next — that is, the one that will take the least time to complete.

It’s **non-preemptive**, meaning:

* Once a process starts running, it **keeps the CPU until it finishes**.
* Even if a new process arrives that would take less time, the running process **is not interrupted**.

---

### 🔹 Preemptive SJF (Shortest Remaining Time First, or SRTF)

The **preemptive version of SJF** is called **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**.

Here’s what **being preemptive** means in this context:

* The CPU can **switch (preempt)** from the currently running process to another one **if a new process arrives with a shorter remaining burst time**.
* The scheduler **constantly compares** the remaining execution times of all ready processes (including the currently running one).
* If a newly arrived process has **less remaining time** than the current one, the CPU is **taken away** (preempted) and given to the new process.

---

### 🔹 Example

| Time | Process | Burst Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| 0    | P1      | 8          |
| 1    | P2      | 4          |

* **SJF (non-preemptive):**
  P1 starts at 0 and runs for 8 units (even though P2 arrives at 1 and only needs 4 units).
[O  P2 runs after P1 finishes.

* **SRTF (preemptive):**
  P1 starts at 0.
  At time 1, P2 arrives with a burst of 4.
  Since 4 < P1’s remaining 7, P1 is **preempted**, and P2 runs next.

---

### 🔹 Summary

| Feature                     | SJF (Non-Preemptive) | SRTF (Preemptive)                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Interrupts running process? | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                      |
| Decision basis              | Total burst time     | Remaining burst time                       |
| Response to new shorter job | Waits                | Preempts                                   |
| Complexity                  | Simpler              | More complex (needs continuous monitoring) |

---

Would you like me to show a step-by-step **timeline example** comparing SJF vs SRTF with multiple processes? It really helps make the preemption behavior clear.


# 2

That’s an excellent question — and you’re actually **very close** to the correct understanding! Let’s carefully unpack your sentence, identify what’s right, and refine the details that need tightening.

---

### 🧩 Your sentence:

> “The run time could be divided into CPU bursts and I/O operations managed by system call.”

Let’s analyze piece by piece.

---

### ✅ What you got right

1. **“Run time could be divided into CPU bursts and I/O operations”**
   ✔️ **Correct idea!**

   * A process alternates between **CPU bursts** (when it’s using the CPU to execute instructions) and **I/O bursts** (when it’s waiting for input/output operations to complete).
   * So conceptually, a process’s lifetime looks like this:

     ```
     CPU burst → I/O → CPU burst → I/O → ... → Termination
     ```
   * This alternation is **fundamental** to how operating systems schedule processes.

2. **You linked I/O to “system calls”**
   ✔️ **Partially correct.**

   * Many I/O operations indeed involve **system calls** (e.g., `read()`, `write()`, `open()` in Linux).
   * When a user process performs an I/O system call, control passes to the **kernel**, which manages the I/O device, possibly putting the process in a **waiting (blocked)** state until the operation finishes.

So, your mental model — “CPU bursts and I/O managed by system calls” — is definitely on the right track.

---

### ⚙️ Where the phrasing needs adjustment

1. **“Run time” might be a bit vague.**

   * Better to say **“process execution time”** or **“the lifetime of a process”** is divided into CPU and I/O bursts.
   * “Run time” can be interpreted as wall-clock time or total time elapsed, which isn’t exactly what you mean.

2. **I/O isn’t always directly caused by system calls.**

   * Many I/O operations are *initiated* by system calls, but not *every* I/O event is managed directly that way from the process’s perspective.
   * For instance, **page faults**, **DMA transfers**, or **asynchronous I/O completions** involve I/O activity that the OS handles without explicit system calls each time.

So, it’s more accurate to say:

> A process alternates between **CPU bursts** (when it’s executing instructions) and **I/O bursts** (when it’s waiting for I/O operations, often initiated via system calls).

---

### 🧠 Putting it all together

Here’s a refined version of your idea:

> A process’s execution can be seen as a sequence of **CPU bursts** (where it performs computation) and **I/O bursts** (where it waits for input/output operations, often triggered by system calls that the OS handles).

---

### 🪄 TL;DR summary

| Concept                                | You Said | Reality                                                     | Verdict           |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Run time divided into CPU and I/O      | ✅        | Yes, process lifetime alternates between CPU and I/O bursts | Correct           |
| I/O operations managed by system calls | ⚠️       | Often true, but not always directly through system calls    | Partially correct |
| “Run time” terminology                 | ⚠️       | Better to say “process execution time”                      | Needs rewording   |

---

Would you like me to show how this CPU–I/O alternation looks visually in a process timeline (like a diagram or example with times)? It makes the idea of “bursts” very clear.


# 3

Perfect 👍 — let’s walk through a simple example and visualize how a process alternates between **CPU bursts** and **I/O operations** over time.

---

### 🧩 Scenario: One process doing some work

Imagine a single process (P_1) that performs some computation, then reads a file, then computes again, and finally writes some output.

---

### 🔹 Step-by-step timeline

| Time  | Activity         | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0–4   | **CPU Burst #1** | The process is actively executing instructions on the CPU — doing arithmetic, logic, etc.                                          |
| 4–9   | **I/O Burst #1** | The process requests a file read (system call). It’s now **blocked**, waiting for the disk. The CPU gives time to another process. |
| 9–14  | **CPU Burst #2** | Data from the disk is ready; the process is back on the CPU doing computations on that data.                                       |
| 14–18 | **I/O Burst #2** | The process calls `write()` to save results. It waits again while the OS handles the disk write.                                   |
| 18–20 | **CPU Burst #3** | Final calculations before completion.                                                                                              |
| 20    | **Termination**  | Process finishes execution.                                                                                                        |

### 🔹 Key observations

* **CPU bursts:** When the process is running on the CPU.
* **I/O bursts:** When the process is waiting for I/O (e.g., disk, keyboard, network).
* While a process is doing I/O, the CPU can **switch** to another process — this is where **CPU scheduling** (like SJF or SRTF) becomes important.
* The system call (like `read()` or `write()`) usually **starts** an I/O burst, but the waiting time itself is managed by the OS and device drivers.

---

### 🧠 Why this matters

Schedulers like **SJF** or **SRTF** care about **CPU bursts** — they decide **which process should get the CPU next** based on predicted or measured burst lengths.

---

Would you like me to add a **second process** to this timeline, to show how scheduling actually happens while one process is waiting on I/O? It’s a great next step for seeing how SJF or SRTF operates in practice.

# 5

Excellent — now we’ll make the comparison **quantitative** so you can *see exactly why* preemption (SRTF) can improve performance.

We’ll use the **same setup** from before:

| Process | Arrival Time | CPU Burst 1 | I/O Burst | CPU Burst 2 |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **P1**  | 0            | 5           | 5         | 4           |
| **P2**  | 2            | 3           | 3         | 2           |

We’ll compare two cases:

1. **SJF (non-preemptive)**
2. **SRTF (preemptive)**

---

## 🧮 1️⃣ SJF (Non-preemptive)

### Step-by-step execution

* **0–5:** P1 runs (its first CPU burst = 5).
* **5–10:** P1 does I/O → CPU is free.
* **5–8:** P2 runs (its first CPU burst = 3).
* **8–10:** P2 does I/O (3 units). CPU idle.
* **10–14:** P1 (I/O done) runs its second CPU burst = 4.
* **14–16:** P2 (I/O done) runs its second CPU burst = 2.

---

### 📋 Now calculate waiting time & turnaround time

**Definitions:**

* **Waiting time** = Time spent in Ready Queue (not running or doing I/O).
* **Turnaround time** = Completion time − Arrival time.

#### For P1:

* Arrival: 0
* CPU bursts: [0–5], [10–14]
* I/O: [5–10]
* Completion: 14

Waiting time:

* Before 1st CPU burst: 0 (immediate start)
* Between I/O done (10) and 2nd CPU start (10): 0
  ✅ Total waiting = **0**

Turnaround = 14 − 0 = **14**

#### For P2:

* Arrival: 2
* CPU bursts: [5–8], [14–16]
* I/O: [8–11]
* Completion: 16

Waiting time:

* Waits from 2→5 before first CPU burst = 3
* Waits from 11→14 before second CPU burst = 3
  ✅ Total waiting = **6**

Turnaround = 16 − 2 = **14**

---

### 🧾 Averages (SJF)

| Metric          | P1 | P2 | **Average** |
| --------------- | -- | -- | ----------- |
| Waiting time    | 0  | 6  | **3.0**     |
| Turnaround time | 14 | 14 | **14.0**    |

---

## 🧮 2️⃣ SRTF (Preemptive)

Now we allow preemption when a process with a **shorter remaining time** arrives.

### Step-by-step execution

* **0–2:** P1 runs (remaining 3).
* **2:** P2 arrives (needs 3). Equal — let’s keep P1 running.
* **0–5:** P1 finishes first burst (5).
* **5–10:** P1 in I/O.
* **5–8:** P2 runs first burst (3).
* **8–10:** P2 I/O (3). CPU idle.
* **10:** P1 ready (needs 4).
* **11:** P2 ready (needs 2).

  * Compare: P1 remaining 3 (after 1 unit), P2 needs 2 → **P2 preempts P1**.
* **11–13:** P2 runs and finishes (13).
* **13–16:** P1 resumes and finishes (16).

---

### 📋 Waiting & turnaround times

#### P1:

* Arrival: 0
* Completion: 16
  Waiting time:

  * No wait before first CPU burst.
  * After I/O, resumes at 10, preempted at 11 → waits from 11–13 = 2
    ✅ Total waiting = **2**
    Turnaround = 16 − 0 = **16**

#### P2:

* Arrival: 2
* First CPU burst starts at 5 → waits 3
* I/O from 8–11 → resumes immediately at 11
  ✅ Total waiting = **3**
  Turnaround = 13 − 2 = **11**

---

### 🧾 Averages (SRTF)

| Metric          | P1 | P2 | **Average** |
| --------------- | -- | -- | ----------- |
| Waiting time    | 2  | 3  | **2.5**     |
| Turnaround time | 16 | 11 | **13.5**    |

---

## ⚖️ 🧠 Comparison Summary

| Metric              | **SJF** | **SRTF** | **Improvement** |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Avg Waiting Time    | 3.0     | **2.5**  | ✅ Lower         |
| Avg Turnaround Time | 14.0    | **13.5** | ✅ Lower         |

---

### 🔹 Intuitive takeaway

* **Preemption helps** because shorter remaining jobs (like P2’s 2-unit final burst) don’t get stuck waiting behind longer ones.
* The system becomes more **responsive**, especially for short or interactive processes.
* However, SRTF needs **constant knowledge of burst lengths** — which in reality must be **estimated**, not known perfectly.
