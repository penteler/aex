# risk 
wait I'm not done yet I had mistakenly pressed enter without using shift. Sorry about that.
This part that I'm typing is just for the two of us and not for the assignment. Similarly the detailed/brief explanations that you're giving are only meant for my understanding. None of this will be officially submitted but it will be stored in my cranial memory. The file system in there is not as reliable any info that is deemed to be uninteresting by the pituitary gland is at risk of getting overwritten by something more interesting.  
Thank you for the feedback now I'm going to pick up where I had left off:
Now because A finishes at 4 the completion time is 4 and since nothing else with a shorter remaining time has arrived so the remaining time of  B can now begin its decent.
D arrives at 5 with a remaining time of 5 and lucky for B it is less than it's remaining time which at this point is  4 (just shy of D's remaining time)
B will continue to run uninterrupted by any other arrival of any other process with a shorter remaining time with a completion time of 9.
After B finishes D can begin running and it will have a completion time of 14. C on the other hand can't catch a break from waiting in queue( is that really how spelled please explain in detail) despite begin in the ready state.
C has to run from 14 to 20 that makes it's completion time 20.

So did I get it or am I missing something?
