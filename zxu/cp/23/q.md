2. Create a package in Python named “Interest” and within this package create two
modules simple.py and compound.py. Introduce simple-interest() function in
simple.py module and compound-interest() function in compound.py module.
Now, import the developed package and modules in your program and use the
functions simple-interest() and compound-interest() to compute simple interest
and compound interest for the values of Principle amount, rate of interest and
time period; entered by the user. 20

entered by the user and Fibonacci (n) is to find Fibonacci series up to a given
number n, entered by the user
Perform the following tasks:
i) import the developed module “Calculator.py”
ii) Call the functions available in Calculator.py
a) To generate Fibonacci series up to number n, entered by user.
b) To determine factorial of the number n, entered by user
