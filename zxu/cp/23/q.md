Q3.
(a) A software company has two divisions, A and B, developing mobile apps. Division A develops 60%
of the apps, and Division B develops 40%. It is known that 5% of apps from Division A have bugs,
while 8% of apps from Division B have bugs. If an app selected at random is found to have a bug, what
is the probability that it was developed by Division A?
