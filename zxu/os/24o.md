Okay so lets say P1 needs R1 but R1 is occupied by P2 and P2 will not release R1 because it also needs R2 which has been occupied by P1 and P1 as we said is waiting for R1 to be freed to finish its execution. It seems like there is no mecanism/rule to preemptively free up one of these resources so that at least one of these processes can be executed. For this reason they are stuck in a circular wait because the processes in a deadlock are holding one resource while waiting for another resource held by another process and because of mutual exclusion resources cannot be shared. Am I missing anything?
